CLUSTERING TASK: Banner placement
Imagine that the international cruise agency Carnival Cruise Line decided to advertise itself with the help of banners and turned to you for this. To test whether such banners are of great use, only 20 of them will be placed around the world. You need to choose 20 such locations for placement, so that the benefits are great, and the agency continues to cooperate with you. The agency is large and has several offices around the world. Near these offices, it wants to place banners - it is easier to negotiate and check the result. Also, these places should be popular among tourists.

To find the best places, we will use the database of the largest social network based on locations â€” Foursquare.

Part of the open data is, for example, on the website archive.org:
